// Batched read-ahead.
//
// A segment fetch spends one idle round trip between the last byte of one
// article and the first byte of the next, because the BODY for the next one is
// only sent once the current reply is complete. Handing a connection several
// segments at once removes that gap: the provider is already sending article
// N+1 when article N ends.
//
// Depth and fan-out are substitutes, not additions. A read-ahead window is a
// fixed number of segments, so putting D of them on one connection uses D times
// fewer connections to cover it — and providers commonly throttle per
// connection, which is why anyone runs twenty of them. Spending depth is
// therefore only free when there is no idle connection left to spend instead.
//
// readAheadBatchSize is that rule: batch only what does not fit across the
// connections this stream can actually get. When the pool has room, batches are
// one segment and the path behaves exactly as it did before. When the stream is
// connection-starved — a per-stream cap, several streams sharing an account,
// read-ahead falling behind the read pointer — batches grow to depth and the
// same connections carry several articles each. That is precisely the case
// pipelining wins, and precisely the case extra goroutines would only have
// queued up inside getConnection.

// readAheadBatchSize spreads unclaimed segments across the connections still
// free (width minus what this file already has in flight), then caps the result
// at depth. It returns 1 when every segment can have a connection to itself.
