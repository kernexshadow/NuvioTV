// not be fetched, so the gaps were zero-filled past the tolerated threshold.

// 4 MiB articles, where the same 24 becomes ~100 MB: the connections share the
// line fairly, so the one segment the reader is blocked on arrives no sooner
// than the twenty-three it does not need yet. A seek into such a release logged
// forty-odd concurrent fetches all completing together at 10-11 seconds each,
// with the serve blocked on reads for 99% of the window.
//
// What the window is really buying is seconds of playback: bytes = bitrate ×
// seconds. Sizing it as a fraction of the file gives exactly that without
// needing to know the bitrate, because the size cancels — a fraction of the
// file is the same fraction of the runtime, at any bitrate. The clamps keep it
// honest at the ends, where a small file would starve and a 67 GB one would put
// a hundred megabytes back in front of its own next read.
